## Raspberry Pi resources

There are lots of resources online for learning to program and use a Raspberry Pi, but probably the best place to start is on the [Raspberry Pi Foundation's website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/).

There are lots of different resources for all ability levels, but the links below might give you some ideas of where to start.

### Beginner resources

- [Santa detector](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/santa-detector/)

### Intermediate resources

## Code Club resources

You can have a look at the Code Club resources [here](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/). If you want full access to all of the resources that are produced by Code Club, then you'll need to start a club in a local school. That way, you'll be able to share your child's love of physical computing with their peers. Sign up to start a Code Club [here](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/start-a-club/volunteers).

## Code Club Resources

You can have a look at the Code Club resources [here](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/). If you want full access to all of the Resources that are produced by Code Club, then you'll need to start a club in a local school. That way you'll be able to share your child's love of Physical Computing with their peers. Sign up to start a Code Club [here](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/start-a-club/volunteers).

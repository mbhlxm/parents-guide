# Physical Computing with the Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is not just an exceptionally cheap computer. One of the main reasons the Raspberry Pi has become so popular is that it allows you to start exploring the world of Physical Computing.

## What is Physical Computing

The Raspberry Pi has two rows of pins called **G**eneral **P**urpose **I**nput **O**utput pins. What is special about these pins is that you can control them using software. That is you can make some of the pins output around 3 volts, or have them detect when they are connected to around 3 volts. This may not sound very exciting, until you realise that this means you can do anything from turning on LEDs and detecting button pushes, to creating remote controlled robots and home automation systems.

## What you will need

To get started with Physical Computing, you'll need to buy a few things, such as electronic components. The following things are really useful.

1. A breadboard
2. Jumper leads
3. LEDs
4. Resistors
5. Push-to-make switches
6. Buzzers

These are all fairly cheap to purchase from [RS](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/) and [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/bhp/electronic-components), as well as many other online shops. You can also find much of what you need in the three [camjam kits](http://camjam.me/?page_id=618) available from the Pi Hut.

## Getting Started

There are hundreds of online tutorials detailing how to get started with Physical Computing on the Raspberry Pi, but probably the best place to start is with the Foundation's own resources. Depending on the age of your child, they might prefer to use Python or Scratch as a programming language. These two resources are a perfect place to get started.
